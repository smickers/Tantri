CST Year One - CWEB195 Project
The goal for this project was to re-design an existing website - I chose Tantrix Body Art based out of Saskatoon, SK.
Web design and logo design are (c) me. Artist photo created using a Power Puff Girls character creator (same one used to create my current avatar).
All tattoo images are (c) Tantrix Body Art and their respective artists.
